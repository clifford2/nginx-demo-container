<h1>Demo Container Error</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx demo container has successfully started,
<em>but is not working as designed</em>. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p>The most likely cause of this is if the <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code>
directory is not writable, which can happen if you run the container in
Kubernetes with a <code>readOnlyRootFilesystem</code>, but did not mount
a volume for <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> which is writable by UID {NGINX_UID}.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/clifford2/nginx-demo-container/blob/main/deploy/k8s-latest.yaml">github.com/clifford2/nginx-demo-container/blob/main/deploy/k8s-latest.yaml</a> for an example Kubernetes deployment manifest that addresses this.

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
